# Inventory_Management
This is a simple management system to handle the inventory in shops, stores and other places that take care of goods in a standardized manner.  

### What does it use?
This system is built using mysql DBMS and consists of tables that are interlinked with each other. This can be found in the Diagram given in the report.  

### How does it function?
Every time we update one part of the table, since each table is interlinked it not only manages the redundant data, but also updates the entire system simultaneously 
thereby allowing us to see if we are affecting another part of the table in the wrong way if we are trying to change anything on one part.
